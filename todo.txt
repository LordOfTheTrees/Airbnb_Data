2) start digging deeper around variables using scatter plots

4. Create Activity/Velocity Metrics
Why: Proxies for occupancy (1.3) and market health signals (question 2)

reviews_per_month = number_of_reviews / months_since_first_review
log_reviews_per_month
recent_review_velocity - reviews in last 3 months vs historical average
Active listings = attractive markets
5. Calculate Price-per-Capacity Metrics
Why: Essential for question 3.1.1 (sizing) and comparing property types apples-to-apples

review_score_ratio = review_score / city_median_review_score
price_premium_for_quality = price_zscore - expected_price_given_bedrooms_baths
quality_segment - categorize as budget/standard/premium based on scores + amenities
8. Create Market Structure Variables
Why: Helps answer question 2 (predict future attractiveness) - market dynamics matter

host_listing_count - is this from a professional or casual host?
superhosts_pct_by_city - market professionalization level
entire_home_pct_by_city - market composition
median_host_experience_months - mature vs emerging market
Markets with more professionals may be saturated OR more stable
9. Construct Trend/Growth Indicators (if you have historical data)
Why: Questions 1.1.3, 1.2.3, 1.3.2, 1.4.2 - all ask about trends

review_growth_rate = (recent_reviews - old_reviews) / old_reviews
new_listing_rate_by_city - supply growth
price_change_yoy if you have snapshots
Growing activity = growing markets = opportunity
10. Build Cross-Variable Interaction Terms
Why: Some effects only matter in combination - reveals hidden patterns

property_type × log_accommodates - does size matter differently for houses vs apartments?
superhost × review_score - does superhosts status amplify quality premium?
bedrooms × city_tier - are extra bedrooms worth more in bigger cities?
Test: "Being a superhosts adds 12% premium in competitive markets, only 3% in small ones"

3) insert computed metrics for profitability into the data

estimated_annual_revenue = price × (365 - availability_365) × occupancy_proxy
revenue_per_accommodates - size-adjusted returns
estimated_revenue_zscore_within_city - relative performance
Note: You'll need to infer occupancy from reviews or availability

price_per_accommodates
price_per_bedroom (handle studios carefully)
revenue_per_bed
Reveals which property configurations have best unit economics
6. Segment by Property Type + Size Combinations
Why: Directly addresses question 3 (what types provide highest returns?)

Create bins: studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3+BR × property_type (entire home, private room, etc.)
Calculate median metrics for each segment within each city
Find: "2BR entire homes in Austin have 23% higher revenue/accommodates than 1BR"
7. Build Quality-Adjusted Metrics
Why: Question 1.4 (quality of stay) - need to separate premium pricing from quality premium

4) identify hotspots of profitability by lat / long boundaries.

6) reason into causal chains and build models

Simple OLS: log_price ~ log_accommodates + bedrooms + bathrooms + review_scores_rating + city_dummies

Purpose: Baseline hedonic model
Interpretation: Percentage effects of each attribute

Revenue Model: log_est_revenue ~ log_price + occupancy_proxy + reviews_per_month + city_dummies

Purpose: Revenue decomposition - what matters more, price or occupancy?

Property Type Comparison: Same models as above, but run separately for property_type segments

Purpose: "Entire homes follow different rules than private rooms"

City Rankings: Calculate predicted revenue for "standard property" (median attributes) in each city

Purpose: Direct answer to "which markets are most attractive?"

Only then: If patterns are clear and you want risk assessment → Monte Carlo simulation

7) explore how they are replicated or validated in training vs testing sets 

    # List your city folder names here
    city_folders = ['Albany', 'Asheville', 'Austin', 'Bozeman', 'Cambridge', 'Chicago',
                   'Columbus', 'Dallas', 'Denver', 'Hawaii', 'Jersey_City', 'Los_Angeles', 
                   'Nashville', 'New_Orleans', 'New_York', 'Oakland', 'Oregon', 'Paris',
                    'Paris', 'Rhode_Island', 'San_Francisco', 'Seattle', 'Washington_DC']
