The diverse area is well known for its wide variety of ethnic restaurants, bars, live music and theatre venues. Many startups have moved research and office operations into the Square to take advantage of the relatively low costs and the proximity to MIT. Nearly demolished in the 1950s, the neighborhood was spared and went so far as to experience a sort of renaissance. In 2012, the state of Massachusetts designated Central Square as an official Cultural District."
