neighborhood_overview,discrete_categorical,2402.0,2172,44.24,"""From its early beginnings during the Gold Rush era, The Mile High City has always been a gathering place for diverse and creative people. Today, Denver is an outdoor city with a vibrant, walkable downtown offering urban adventures for all ages. Within a one-mile radius, you can kayak on the Platte River; explore some of the city's best museums; shop at art galleries and boutiques; see a Broadway touring show; enjoy live music; ride a rollercoaster or cool off in a water park; and experience exciting professional sports. Downtown is also home to many of Denver's top farm-to-table restaurants and innovative craft breweries, and the Denver Beer Trail is a great guide to sampling those local brews. <br /><br />Downtown's free 16th Street Mall shuttle makes it even easier to get around. Visit Larimer Square and the newly renovated Denver Union Station in historic Lower Downtown (Lodo), where Victorian buildings now house restaurants, galleries, shops, bars, brewpubs and coffee houses, or h","📍 RiNo Art District is the best place to stay in Denver, hands down. Younger/hip demographic, lots of fun and partying to be had, yet it’s still quiet at night. <br /><br />📝 Once your reservation is confirmed, I’ll send the “Top 5” list that I created which has numerous categorized recommendations. <br /><br />🏈 Directly across the street from my home is Curtis Park, which is Denver’s first park! It’s massive, so grab a frisbee or football and have at it! <br /><br />🏊‍♀️ Also, the park across the street has a PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL, TENNIS COURTS, BASKETBALL COURTS, HORSESHOE PITS, OUTDOOR WORKOUT AREA and more.",,,,,,"Denver is a colorful culture capital brimming with art, energy, and local personality, and nowhere is it more evident than in trendy RiNo — the River North Arts District. This is the place where art is made, where culinary delights are crafted, and where progressive ideas are swapped in cozy cafés. Lucky for you, Catbird is right in the middle of it all, sitting pretty in RiNo and serving as your gateway to all that is hip and happening in Denver."
