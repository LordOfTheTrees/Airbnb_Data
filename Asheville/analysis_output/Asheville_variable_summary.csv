","“Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life—and travel—leaves marks on you.”  – Anthony Bourdain.

We LIVE to travel! Heather spent many years working in the airline industry which allowed us to see 40+ countries. The Anthony Bourdain show “No Reservations”  sums up our travel style. We tend to book the first night to recover from jet lag and then keep the rest of the trip open. We like to see where our travels want to take us. Seeking out the “undiscovered” places and truly connecting with locals is what we are all about. Some of our favorites: Luang Prabang / Bagan / Zanzibar / Bali / Colombia / Ronda (got engaged) / Samana, Dominican Republic (got married) / Chicago / Isla Holbox (shhhh, keep it a secret). Through many of these travels Airbnb has been a big piece of the puzzle.  

The two of us met in Aspen, CO. Heather is originally from Chicago and Mark from Virginia Beach. Although Heather loved city life her wanderlust brought her to Aspen for thirteen years.  Mark had been living in Washington D.C. doing the daily grind as an architect and had heard about a firm in Aspen that was hiring. He jumped on the chance and never looked back!  Aspen was a fantastic place to live and truly enjoy life. It taught us that you can live more simply and have a healthier quality of life. 

After a long stint out west and with a child on the way we decided it was time to be closer to family. We had a list of 30 towns all over the midwest and eastern U.S. which we either visited or did research on. After visiting Asheville we knew it was our next stop in life. Mark has opened his own office and Heather teaches at a creative arts center while studying interior design. Besides continuing to travel, we hike with our son and two dogs as often as possible and love checking out the awesome breweries and restaurants Asheville has to offer. We've also just begun hosting on Airbnb and really enjoy meeting fellow travelers and hosting them in our guest suite. 

We hope to inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and check out other places and people on this amazing planet! 

""Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves."" 
- Henry David Thoreau
