neighborhood_overview,discrete_categorical,6332.0,7273,47.89,"""A mile from downtown, East Austin has historically been a working-class neighborhood, a vibrant enclave heavily populated by African-Americans because of an earlier era of segregationist laws — and later, a home to Mexican-American residents. These days, it’s also the city’s newly fashionable arts district, with studios, galleries, cocktail bars, cafes and all manner of food trucks popping up on most every block. Beloved taquerias and barbecue joints, ramshackle carwashes and Christian outreach ministries now jostle against shiny condos, fancy restaurants and, in refurbished bungalows, groovy hair salons with names like Peacock and Orbit."" - Bonnie Tsui, NY Times",🧭 Prime Location = Endless Possibilities<br />🎓 0.5 mi to St. Edward’s University<br /><br />🏫 6.6 mi to UT Austin<br /><br />🌮 Walk to SoCo’s famous foodie scene & Downtown restaurants<br /><br />✈️ 7 mi to Austin-Bergstrom Airport<br /><br />🏥 1.3 mi to St. David’s Medical Center<br /><br />💼 Near major business + meeting hubs,,,,,,"• CW Austin Resort is in Austin, Texas."
