",我是三个孩子的单亲妈妈，平常喜欢带孩子到公园散步，或者参加一些户外的活动.我的房源都需要提早一天预定，这样我才有足够的时间整理打扫干净房子.,,,,,,"Used to be a professor (Ph.D. in Political Economy), then a homeschooling mom and  a religious non profit organization founder, now like to travel, read / review books and manage properties. The best cities I like are Seattle, Florence, Sanya and Taipei.  (Taipei is chosen as the #1 out of 26 Remarkable Places For Solo Travel by BuzzFeed!  (Website hidden by Airbnb) We have  a few nicely furnished studios and one bedrooms condo apt conveniently located near University of Washington in Seattle with your own private kitchen and bathroom.  You will enjoy the convenient locations and quietness of all these buildings. You will also be surprised how quickly we respond to your requests as long as I am in town.  My motto is Providing Quality Places at Fair Prices and my life motto is in Philippians 4:13. 
BTW, I am praised for responsiveness. But I usually do not answer the phone calls on Sundays due to church meetings unless it is urgent, if not,  but need to let me know prefer you just text me next day or on Sunday afternoon.  Thank you.
