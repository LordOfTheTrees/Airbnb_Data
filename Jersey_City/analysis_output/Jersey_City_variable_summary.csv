neighborhood_overview,discrete_categorical,515.0,1072,58.61,"""The Heights"" is a diverse neighborhood in Jersey City.  Local grocery, limited restaurant/deli and liquor stores are within a 5-20 minute walk.  There are also two urban parks, Pershing Field and Gordon Park, that are a quick walk from the house.  Pershing field has playground equipment, tennis courts and other amenities.  <br /><br />Please note ""the Heights"" is not in the downtown  area of Jersey City that borders the Hudson River.  The Heights is primarily residential, rather than a commercial neighborhood.  You can reach Jersey City's waterfront via 2 subway stops, Grove Street or Exchange Place or take a taxi there.  <br /><br />If you want local 'action' in the evening, this is probably not the right property for you.  If you want a large number of trendy restaurants, bars, high end shops within a 5 minute walk, this is probably not the right property for you.<br /><br />Our listing is in a residential, quiet neighborhood.","🏙️ Prime Location:<br /><br />Nestled in the heart of Jersey City, this neighborhood perfectly blends urban energy with residential comfort.<br /><br />Just minutes from Manhattan, it offers easy access to the city’s vibrant life while maintaining a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere.<br /><br />🌆 Views and Atmosphere:<br /><br />Located on the iconic JFK Boulevard, surrounded by a mix of classic and modern architecture.<br /><br />Enjoy a safe and friendly neighborhood, ideal for exploring on foot or using public transportation.<br /><br />🍴 Local Food Scene:<br /><br />A wide variety of restaurants just steps away, from authentic Latin and Asian cuisine to classic diners and cozy cafes.<br /><br />Nearby recommendations: Rumba Cubana (authentic Cuban food), Miss America Diner (classic American dishes), and Dulce de Leche Bakery for sweet treats.<br /><br />🌳 Parks and Recreation:<br /><br />Close to Lincoln Park, a large green space perfect for walking, jogging, or outdoor activities.<b",,,,,,"Why stay in Manhattan when you can savor the peace and quiet of this luxurious Jersey City high-rise? Away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and Fifth Avenue, this Downtown Jersey City building is a better value than anything you’d find across the Hudson - and you can still get to NYC in minutes via the ferry or the PATH train.<br /><br />Rest and relax in this peaceful oasis perched on the edge of the river, which features plush mattresses, sophisticated wood furnishings, and spacious closets so you can unpack and stay for a while. In the bathroom, you’ll find masterful tile work and modern fixtures - plus towels and toiletries provided for your convenience.<br /><br />After a day at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a matinee show on Broadway, or a packed agenda of meetings, you’re bound to be hungry, Cook up a storm in the full kitchen, which features stainless steel appliances, including a full-size fridge and freezer, an electric stove, an oven, a microwave, and a dishwashe"

Hello, and welcome to our home. My husband and I would be so happy to host you in our newly constructed Jersey City condo. We both share a huge passion for travel, and we have been blessed to live and visit many places all over the world. Chris and I decided to root ourselves in the city that has so much to offer which is Jersey City. While settling here, we decided to give our fellow travel lovers a place that feels like home. With southern hospitality in our roots, we have a deep love for hosting, and we look forward to extending that love and warmth to our new friends.
Our modern, sun-drenched condo offers a tranquil vibe, which is perfect to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. This location is perfect for families who want to visit Jersey City  or New York area. The location is prime for any sports enthusiasts as we are a quick fifteen-minute drive to MetLife stadium—home of the New York Giants and New York Jets. The area is also suited for travel healthcare professionals, as we are near many hospitals including Jersey City hospital. Newark international airport is a quick twelve-minute drive and in thirty minutes you are in the BIG APPLE! New York City.
